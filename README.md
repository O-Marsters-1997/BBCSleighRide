**FULL BRIEF**

**MVP - the must haves**

We chose to create educational content about Christmas around the world; fictitiously commissioned by the BBC. As a key feature, our web app centres around an interactive world map.

1. **Map**: Users will be able to select a country from the map and see some key facts about Christmas in that country. The prototype will include a limited selection of countries, including at least one from each continent. When you click on the country, you will see these key facts:
   - How to say Merry Christmas
   - Main Day Celebrated On
   - Christmas Meal
2. **Quiz** - To maintain educational purpose, the user will be able to click on a button that takes them to a quiz, to test their learning from the Christmas app
3. **Joke** - For some entertaining festive spirit, the user will be able to click on a button that reveals a random Christmas joke
4. **Design** - BBC Theme, Christmas Colour Palette, Well Rounded Design (as a minimum) for the MVP.

**Extensions - the should haves / could haves**

Identified below are ideas for further development. Some of them have been implemented, as indicated.

To help improve the user experience, some additional features include:

- A Santa Chatbot (npm library) (complete)
- 'Let it snow' button triggering falling snow (complete)
- Quiz Interactivity (complete):
  - Visual representations or indications of results or progress
  - Candy Cane life counter
  - Christmas Colour palette used to full
  - Results saved to database
- Interactive game, such as tic-tac-toe (in development - 'present' placeholder created)
- Music/Audio - Potential previews of a country’s song, as well as some audio effects for things like Christmas Crackers and Sledges
- Search Bar - To help users who don’t know the location of a particular country, the app will include a search bar
- Joke/Fact - add a fact into the jokes area, and make it like pulling a Christmas cracker that has a joke on one side and a random fact on the other
- Extra Design - Interactivity with buttons, enhanced versions of the MVP:
  - Loading Screen - Sleigh
  - Custom Pins on Map - candy canes
- Blog Content
  - Ability to scale the level of content with further information in mind (Without intruding on the user experience)
  - Also potential work with the BBC API, to filter the stories according to Christmas topics
  - Signposting towards other resources, that would allow for further years to interact with the app
